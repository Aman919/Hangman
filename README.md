# Hangman
It is a simple hangman game(hangman.py) implemented in python. It has text file(word.py) including all the words. Please make sure to keep all the files in one directory or else it will not work. This game selects any random word from the file and asks you to guess characters of that word. You will get 6 chances to guess a word. When you guess a correct character your chance will not be counted else your chance will be reduced by one.
